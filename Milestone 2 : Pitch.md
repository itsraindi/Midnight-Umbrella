## 1) Game Summary (High Concept)
**Hidden Threads** is a 2D mystery game combining psychological tension and social media investigation.  
You investigate your friend’s murder by collecting evidence in the real world and uncovering hidden truths through social media.

## 2) What Makes the Game Unique
- A combination of **mystery + psychological tension + social media investigation**
- **Dual Investigation**: physical evidence + digital/social evidence
- A “watched” atmosphere (surveillance, pressure, uncertainty)

## 3) Player Role
You play as the missing/deceased friend’s **roommate / close friend**, acting as an investigator trying to piece together what happened.
